# Module11-challenge

-During this challenge most of the material referenced came from rewatching lectures as well as assistance during office hours. I also received help from fellow peers with clafication on the assignment requirements as it was not as clear as previous instructions for other assignments.

-the submission requirements where not clear on what exactly was required when submitting this repo. I included the CSV files that was saved although not explicitly mentioned that it was needed to be turned in. Please let me know if anything is missing and i will provide that for you.

-Similar to many of the past challenges Chatgpt was used for refreshers on certain methods and functions within the pandas library. Many of the other challenges that useds pandas and plt were also used as a reference on how to make them. 

- the beautifulsoup documentation was also used a lot for help with parsing through the html as i found that it had better explinations on how to use .methods to complete this project.
